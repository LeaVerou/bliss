Want to use Vanilla JS but find native APIs a bit unwieldy? Bliss is for you.

## Test

npm test
```

## Contribute to Bliss!

- Please follow the existing code style.
- Do not add new methods before consulting.
- If editing Bliss, do not edit bliss.js! It’s auto-generated by gulp. The source files are bliss.shy.js and bliss._.js.
- Remember, code simplicity, readability and conciseness matters a lot for this project. Often juggling the three can be tricky.
- Right now what Bliss badly needs is **tests**. If you want to contribute, please consider contributing tests! See [here](https://github.com/LeaVerou/bliss/blob/gh-pages/tests/README.md) for details.
