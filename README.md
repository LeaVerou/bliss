## Contribute to Bliss!

- Please follow the existing code style.
- Do not add new methods before consulting.
- Remember, code simplicity, readability and conciseness matters a lot for this project. Often juggling the three can be tricky.
- Right now what Bliss badly needs is **tests**. If you want to contribute, please consider contributing tests! See [here](https://github.com/LeaVerou/bliss/blob/gh-pages/tests/README.md) for details.
